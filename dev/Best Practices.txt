Best Practices Journal

Do's:

- Make sure to keep track of seed values that were used to generate random numbers to guarantee reproducibility

Don'ts:

- A paper version of the notebook featuring only the final results will not reflect any changes made in the source code.

- Take care with mathematical operations (such as division) with variables that will be used as indexes. They can turn into floats and generate errors, since indexes should be integers.
